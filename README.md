![alt text](https://www.mdanderson.org/images/publications/cancerwise/Generics/cw-sleep-graphic.jpg)

## Project Overview - Anna
This main objective of this machine learning project aims to analyze a range of lifestyle and medical factors—including age, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, and blood pressure—to predict the likelihood and type of sleep disorders an individual may develop. Conditions such as insomnia and sleep apnea can severely impact overall health and well-being. By identifying those at risk, this study seeks to facilitate early intervention and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately enhancing sleep quality and promoting long-term health.

## Data Set Description - Kaitlyn
The “Sleep, Health, and Lifestyle” dataset is composed of a list of individuals, sorted by age. In total, the dataset contains information on 374 individuals and their corresponding 12 variables making up 375 rows and 12 columns with labeling. The variables cover a broad number of aspects related to sleep health such as sleep data, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular health, and sleep disorders. The variables include:

- Gender, which is sorted into two categories: “Male” and “Female”. 
- Age, in years, spanning all ages from  “27” to “59, with the exception of “46” and “47”. 
- Occupation, which is composed of eleven jobs that include“Doctor”, “Nurse”, “Lawyer”, “Accountant”, “Engineer”, “Software Engineer”, “Sales Representative”, “Salesperson”, “Manager”, and “Teacher”. 
- Sleep duration, in hours up to the tenths, from “5.8” to “8.5” hours. 
- Quality of sleep, based on a subjective rating from 1-10, with the lowest rating at “4” and the highest at “9”. 
- Physical activity level, from low to high, spanning “30” to “90”. 
- Stress level, based on a subjective rating from 1-10, ranging from “3” to “8”. 
- BMI category sorted into “Normal”, “Normal Weight”, “Overweight”, and “Obese”.
- Blood pressure in mmHg or millimeters of mercury. 
- Heart rate in beats per minute, with the lowest at “65” and the highest at “86”. 
- Daily steps, ranging from “3000” to “10000”
- Sleep disorder, separated into the three categories of “Insomnia”, “Sleep Apnea”, or “None”. 


## Patterns found in exploratory data analysis - Navya 
We analyzed medical factors such as age, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, and blood pressure to predict the likelihood and type of sleep disorders an individual may develop. To understand how each factor influences sleep disorders, we visualized distributions and relationships using various plots.

**Observed Patterns**
- More females were diagnosed with a sleep disorder compared to males. The number of women with sleep apnea is higher than those with insomnia. Meanwhile, although men were observed to have a lower likelihood of developing sleep disorders, those who do are more likely to have insomnia than sleep apnea.
-  Individuals with higher BMI had a greater likelihood of developing sleep apnea.

**Handling Missing Values**
- The dataset contained one column with missing values: "Sleep Disorder" (219 missing values).
- These missing values indicate individuals with no diagnosed sleep disorde, so we replaced them with "None" to make the data consistent.

**Unique Value Analysis**
To understand the data better we checked all data for individual sub-categories.
- Gender: 2 categories (Male, Female)
- Age: 31 unique values (used histogram for better visualisation of ranges)
- Occupation: 11 different job roles
- BMI Category: 3 categories (Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- Sleep Disorder Types: 3 categories (None, Sleep Apnea, Insomnia)

**Data Cleaning and simplification**
- We divided the Blood Pressure category into two separate categories of Diastolic and Systolic BP's.
- Changed "Normal weight" to "Normal" for consistency.

**Distribution of Categorical Variables**
- Gender: Males(189), Females(185)
- Occupation:Nurse(73), Doctor(71), Engineer(63), Lawyer(47), Teacher(40), Accountant(37), Salesperson(32), Software Engineer(4), Scientist(4), Sales Representative(2), Manager(1)
  Most Common: Nurse(73), Doctor(71), Engineer(63)
  Least Common: Sales Representative(2), Manager(1)
- BMI: Normal(216), Overweight(148), Obese(10)
- Blood Pressore: Diastolic and Systolic Ranges 

**Key Observations**
- The dataset is balanced in terms of gender (Male: 189, Female: 185).
- Nurses and doctors make up a significant portion of the dataset.
- Most individuals fall into the "Normal" or "Overweight" BMI categories, with only 10 classified as Obese.
- Sleep disorders are nearly evenly distributed between Sleep Apnea and Insomnia, while a majority of individuals (219) have no diagnosed disorder.

## **📊 Model Training and Evaluation**

We trained and evaluated multiple models to determine the **best classification model** for our dataset. Based on **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, focusing on **misclassification trends** to identify areas for improvement.

Each model is assessed using the following parameters:
- **Precision**: How many of the predicted instances were actually correct?
- **Recall**: How well does the model identify all instances of a class?
- **F1-Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
- **Support**: The number of actual instances per class.

---

### **1️⃣ Precision (Positive Predictive Value)**
**"When the model predicts this class, how often is it correct?"**  
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\text{Precision}=\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP}+\text{FP}}" />

For example:
- **Precision = 0.67** → When the model predicts a certain class, it is **correct 67% of the time**.
- **A low precision means the model often misclassifies other classes as that class (False Positives).**

---

### **2️⃣ Recall (Sensitivity)**
**"How well does the model identify actual instances of this class?"**  
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\text{Recall}=\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP}+\text{FN}}" />

For example:
- **Recall = 0.73** → The model correctly identifies **73% of all the actual Class samples**.
- **A recall below 1.0 means some actual instances are misclassified as other classes (False Negatives).**

---

### **3️⃣ F1-Score (Balance Between Precision & Recall)**
**"A single score balancing precision and recall."**  
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\text{F1-Score}=2\times\frac{\text{Precision}\times\text{Recall}}{\text{Precision}+\text{Recall}}" />

- If **precision and recall are both high**, F1-score will be high.
- If one is **low**, F1-score will also be **lower**.

---

### **4️⃣ Support (Number of True Instances per Class)**
**"How many actual samples belong to each class?"**
- **Support does NOT affect model performance.**  
- **But an imbalanced class (low support) may have lower recall.**  
  - Example: **If Class 0 has only 17 samples like in the KNN model**, makes it harder to classify correctly.

**📋 KNN Classification Report**  
Each row corresponds to a **specific class** (e.g., `0`, `1`, or `2`), and each column represents an **evaluation metric**.
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0       0.71      0.88      0.79        17
           1       0.96      0.96      0.96        55
           2       0.89      0.73      0.80        22

    accuracy                           0.89        94
   macro avg       0.86      0.86      0.85        94
weighted avg       0.90      0.89      0.89        94
```
**📌 Metric Breakdown**
| Metric | Class 0 (17 samples) | Class 1 (55 samples) | Class 2 (22 samples) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Precision** |**71%** (29% false positives) | **96%** (only 4% false positives) | **89%** (11% false positives) |
| **Recall** | **88%** (12% false negatives) | **96%** (4% false negatives) | **73%** (27% false negatives) |
| **F1-Score** | **0.79** | **0.96** | **0.80** |
| **Support** | **17** | **55** | **22** |

Despite performing well (89% accuracy), KNN **struggled with Class 2 misclassification** (often confused with Class 0).  
- **SMOTE oversampling did not improve Class 2 recall significantly.**
- **Feature selection slightly improved Class 0 recall but did not help Class 2.**
- **Even with weighted classification** (`weights='distance'`), KNN relies on distance-based decision boundaries, which can be **less effective for overlapping classes**. This is evident in the misclassification of Class 2 as Class 0.**  

**🔹 Confusion Matrix (Feature Selection after SMOTE)**
```
[[15  1  1]
 [ 1 53  1]
 [ 5  1 16]]
```
✅ **Class 0 recall improved (88%).**  
✅ **Class 1 is almost perfectly classified.**   
❌ **Class 2 recall remained low (73%) since it is often confused with Class 0.**  

Since **KNN struggled with Class 2 separability**, we tested **alternative models**.
